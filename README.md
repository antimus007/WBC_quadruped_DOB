# A whole-body controller with disturbance rejection through a momentum-based observer for quadruped robots

This software allows simulating the locomotion of a quadruped robot through a Whole-Body Control. The combination of a motion planner for the trajectory of the robotâ€™s center of mass, a momentum-based observer estimator, and an optimization problem based on the modulation of ground reaction forces allows the robot to reject external disturbances.

The repository contains the following elements:
 * A quadruped robot model  already implemented inside the Gazebo simulator;
 * A plugin to simulate external forces stressing the robot;
 * A scene reproducing an irregular terrain;
 * Some examples to test the proposed controller.
